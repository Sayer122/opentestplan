This is a simple app for test plan management, execution and tracking. It is built with Next.JS and Postgres. It is currently a work in progress but please feel free to submit a pull request if you see something you want to improve.

## Deploying This App

You can compile your own docker container using the Dockerfile provided. An example `docker-compose.yml` has also been provided to get started. This includes a postgres image but can be configured to use postgres hosted elsewhere. Please do change the default passwords.

To compile and deploy locally after cloning this repo:
```
docker build -t opentestplan .
docker compose up -d
```
It will now be running on localhost:80

## Getting Started Developing
